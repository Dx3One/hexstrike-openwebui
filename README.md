# HexStrike OpenWebUI Tool Wrapper  
> A lightweight Python wrapper that exposes the **HexStrike** API as a set of OpenWebUI tools.  
> After cloning the repo, simply edit the `HEXSTRIKE_API` constant to point to your HexStrike MCP instance and add the tool to OpenWebUI.

## What is this?
`hexstrike_openwebui.py` is a thin Python client that talks to the **HexStrike** micro‑service controller (MCP).  
The class `Tools` implements dozens of methods that map directly to the HexStrike API endpoints (e.g. Nmap, SQLMap, Metasploit, etc.).  
When integrated into **OpenWebUI** you can call any of these methods from the chat interface as if they were built‑in tools.

---

## Prerequisites
| Item | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| HexStrike MCP | Must be reachable from the machine running OpenWebUI. |
| OpenWebUI  | The official OpenWebUI repo or a fork that supports custom tools. |

---

## Installation
1. Open `hexstrike_openwebui.py`.  
2. Locate the line:

```python
HEXSTRIKE_API = "http://YOUR-HEX-STRIKE-MCP:8888"
```

3. Replace the URL with the address of your HexStrike MCP, e.g.:

```python
HEXSTRIKE_API = "http://192.168.x.x:8888"
```

> **Important:** The IP/hostname and port must be reachable from the host running OpenWebUI.

---

## Adding the Tool to OpenWebUI
1. Start OpenWebUI.  
2. Navigate to **Workspace → Tools**.  
3. Click **Add Tool**.  
4. Fill in the form:  
   * **Name** – `HexStrike` (or any friendly name).  
   * **Description** – “Wrapper for HexStrike MCP – run scans, exploits, etc.”  
   * **Parameters** – leave blank (the wrapper exposes all methods).  
5. Click **Save**.  

Now you can invoke any method directly from the chat, e.g.:

```
/hexstrike nmap_scan target=example.com
```
